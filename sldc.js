// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the bones of functionality are determined. Developers assess the goals of the software and compile an idea of what code, elements, frameworks, etc. will be necessary to accomplish those goals."
const design = "This is the third step, in which a flow chart or sketch is created for the software based around the requirements needed and end goal. At this point, developers will begin connecting ideas and putting all the details together to form the bigger picture."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the goals is to bring their design to life. Developers use their coding knowledge and resources to actually build their software in this step."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which the newly built software is being rigorously checked for issues and, ultimately, published. Developers will run tests repeatedly until their software is ready for published use."
const maintain = "This is the fifth and final step, in which the software is published and upkept. If an issue arises with the software, developers will be alerted and begin to restore/update/tweak to software as needed."
